# convert-Image-to-pencilDrawing
###Convert a image to Grayscale.

This python code converts an RGB image to grayscale image giving an effect of pencil drawing of the image.
This code uses opencv-python library to get the job done.
To use this code, either download it or open a command prompt and clone the repo like,

> git clone https://github.com/viwicodes/convert-Image-to-pencilDrawing


Then >cd convert-Image-to-pencilDrawing

Voila! There You go!

Now you can simply run  (Use python or python3 according to your python version.)

  > python3 pencilSketch.py 


Note :- 1 Make sure you have python/python3 installed.

        2 Install opencv by typing  (Use pip or pi3 according to your python version.)
        
          > pip3 install opencv-python
          
        3 Be sure to give a valid path to image. Out of the box the default trialIMG.jpg will be used.

ThankYou
